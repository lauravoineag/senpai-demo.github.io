# Senpai-demo

This is my first out of many websites I plan to build.

I have just recently taken a really keen interest into coding after I realised that my skills are code worthy.

I have completed several courses on Codeacademy on HTML, CSS, Bootsrap and Javascript(Jquery) that I applied into my very basic mobile first designed website.

I am currently studying Python in order to achieve Front End and Back End language programming.

I am planning on updating the website as I learn more things.

I wish to secure a job in tech as soon as possible so that I have more time to dedicte to my passion.

Enjoy my website!!

Please view it along with my resume. 

I hope you will be able to see the potential I can bring to your organisation.

Thank you for your time.

My website is : https://lauravoineag.github.io/senpai-demo.github.io/
